The format of the json file is
```
{
  "ProductId": "pr-abcd1234",
  "DeviceId": "de-abcd1234",
  "Server": "pr-abcd1234.devices.nabto.net or pr-abcd1234.devices.dev.nabto.net or something else.",
  "client": {
    "ServerKey": "sk-...",
    "ServerUrl": "https://pr-abcd1234.clients.dev.nabto.net or https://pr-abcd1234.clients.nabto.net or something else",
  }
}
```
