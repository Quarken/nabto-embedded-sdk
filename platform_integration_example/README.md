# Platform Integration Example

This folder contains an example of a platform integration which can be
used on unix systems relying on
the [select](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_(Unix)) method for
event notifications on sockets. The select abstraction is also found
on numereous embedded systems so this example can be used as an base
for such integrations.
